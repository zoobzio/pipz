# Changelog Tracking and Release Automation System Requirements
**Version 1.0** | **Feature:** track-changelog | **Date:** 2025-08-22

## Executive Summary

Our current release infrastructure demonstrates impressive sophistication with GoReleaser integration, automated testing, and comprehensive validation. However, a critical gap remains: **developers must manually create git tags to trigger releases**. This manual step breaks the automation chain and creates opportunities for human error.

**Mission Objective:** Establish a fully automated changelog tracking and release system that infers the next version from semantic commits and enables one-click release triggering without manual tag management.

**Strategic Value:** Reduce time-to-market for releases, eliminate human error in version management, and provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into pending changes and their business impact.

## Business Context and Problem Statement

### Current State Analysis
**Strengths of Existing System:**
- Sophisticated GoReleaser configuration with semantic changelog generation
- Comprehensive validation pipeline (tests, linting, examples)
- Automated release verification and notification
- Professional release notes with proper categorization
- Semantic versioning convention already adopted across commits

**Critical Gap Identified:**
The release process requires manual tag creation, which:
- Creates a bottleneck in the release pipeline
- Introduces risk of version numbering errors
- Prevents true continuous delivery
- Requires developer context-switching for release management
- Makes it difficult to preview what the next release will contain

### Business Impact
- **Developer Productivity:** Manual tag creation disrupts development flow
- **Release Velocity:** Delayed releases due to manual intervention requirements
- **Quality Risk:** Human error in version numbering can cause confusion
- **Stakeholder Visibility:** No preview of pending release content before triggering

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Semantic Version Inference Engine
**Description:** Analyze commit history since last release to determine appropriate version bump.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Parse commits using existing semantic patterns (feat:, fix:, feat!:, etc.)
- Apply semantic versioning rules:
  - PATCH: fix: commits and docs: commits
  - MINOR: feat: commits
  - MAJOR: any commit with ! indicator (feat!:, fix!:, etc.) OR presence of "BREAKING CHANGE" in commit body
- Handle edge cases where no version bump is needed (only docs changes in patch context)
- Provide clear reasoning for version inference decision

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given commits with only fix: since v1.0.0, when analyzing, then suggest v1.0.1
- Given commits with feat: since v1.0.0, when analyzing, then suggest v1.1.0  
- Given commits with feat!: since v1.0.0, when analyzing, then suggest v2.0.0
- Given only docs: commits since v1.0.0, when analyzing, then suggest no release needed OR v1.0.1 (configurable)

### FR-2: Release Preview Generation
**Description:** Generate comprehensive preview of pending release without creating tags.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Display inferred next version with reasoning
- Show complete changelog that would be generated
- List all commits included since last release
- Highlight breaking changes prominently
- Calculate release scope (patch/minor/major) with visual indicators
- Show validation status (would tests pass, linting status, etc.)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Preview shows exact changelog that would appear in release
- Breaking changes are clearly highlighted
- Preview available without modifying repository state
- Preview updates in real-time as new commits are added

### FR-3: Automated Release Triggering Interface
**Description:** Enable authorized release triggering through GitHub interface without manual tag creation.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Integrate with GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch for manual triggering
- Accept optional version override (but default to inferred version)
- Provide confirmation step showing exactly what will be released
- Support different release types (stable, pre-release, hotfix)
- Automatically create appropriate git tag during release process
- Include safety checks to prevent duplicate releases

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Authorized users can trigger release from GitHub Actions tab
- System creates correct git tag automatically during release
- Confirmation step shows complete release details before proceeding
- Invalid release attempts (duplicate versions, dirty working tree) are rejected with clear messaging

### FR-4: Release Status Dashboard
**Description:** Provide clear visibility into current release readiness and pending changes.

**Detailed Requirements:**
- Show current version and next inferred version
- Display commit count and types since last release
- Indicate validation status (tests, linting, examples)
- Show estimated release timeline based on commit patterns
- Highlight any blockers preventing release
- Link to detailed preview and release triggering interfaces

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Dashboard loads within 5 seconds
- Status information updates automatically when new commits are pushed
- Blockers are clearly identified with remediation steps
- Dashboard accessible to non-technical stakeholders

## Open Questions Requiring Clarification

### Business Decisions Needed
1. **Version Inference for Documentation Changes:** Should docs-only changes trigger patch releases or be accumulated until feature/fix changes?

2. **Pre-release Versioning:** How should the system handle alpha/beta/rc releases in the automated flow?

3. **Release Frequency:** Are there any business constraints on maximum release frequency (e.g., no more than one release per day)?

4. **Stakeholder Approval:** Should certain types of releases (major versions, breaking changes) require explicit approval before triggering?

### Technical Clarifications Needed
1. **Permission Model:** Which GitHub teams/individuals should have release triggering permissions?

2. **Failure Handling:** What should happen if the inferred version conflicts with an existing tag?

3. **Multi-branch Support:** Should this system work only on main branch or support feature branch releases?

4. **Notification Requirements:** What communication channels should be notified when releases are triggered/completed?
